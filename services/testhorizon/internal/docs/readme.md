title: TestHorizon
---

TestHorizon is the server for the client facing API for the Test ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [test-core](https://www.test.org/developers/learn/test-core) and applications that want to access the Test network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Test ecosystem](https://www.test.org/developers/guides/) for more details.

You can interact directly with testhorizon via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.test.org/developers/js-test-sdk/learn/) for clients to use to interact with TestHorizon.

SDF runs a instance of TestHorizon that is connected to the test net [https://testhorizon-testnet.test.org/](https://testhorizon-testnet.test.org/).
